TODO List for InTeX			 -*- mode: org; -*-

* TODO Define all possibly needed variants of each concept.
  - The different axis include:
    1. "typeset as" (full-form/short-form)
    2. "inflection" (singular/plural)
    3. "sort as"

  - All entries should be typeset identically in the text and in the
    index.
  - Both of the following example entries in the *CONCEPTS* section
    ('|' represents the left-most border)
    
      |LaTeX@{\LaTeX} cat
      |LaTeX cat@{\LaTeX cat}
    
    should result in the following attributes being defined for an
    IndexEntry instance:
    
      - reference_singular = 'LaTeX cat'
      - reference_plural = 'LaTeX cats'    # Automatically inflected.
      - references = {reference_singular, reference_plural}
    
      - use_singular = '\LaTeX cat'
      - use_plural = '\LaTeX cats'
  
      - index_as_singular = (True | False) # Same form as given in the
                                           # .itx file.
					   
    and if INDEX_AS_SINGULAR is True, then the index entry should be
    typeset like USE_SINGULAR and sorted like REFERENCE_SINGULAR.
    
  - Trying to sum up the needed axis/features:

			singular	plural
      reference		LaTeX(1)
      use		\LaTeX(2)
      index_as		[2]
      index_sort_as	[1]

  - An example with sub-entries ('#-' signals singular form):

      |TeXnician@{{\TeX}nician}
      |  -'s tool
      |  smart -
      
    The first entry will be interpreted as

			singular		plural
      reference		TeXnician(1s)        	TeXnichians(1p)
      use		{\TeX}nician(2s)	{\TeX}nician(2p)
      index_as		[2s]
      index_sort_as	[1s]

    and the second entry will become

			singular		plural
      reference		[1s]'s tool(2.1s)  	[1s]'s tools
      use		[2s]'s tool(2.2s)	[2s]'s tools
      index_as		[2s]
      index_sort_as	[1s]

    while the third entry will become

			singular		plural
      reference		smart [1s](3.1)		smart [1p]
      use		smart [2s](3.2)		smart [2p]
      index_as		[2s]
      index_sort_as	[1s]
